Select which payment gateways are available by billing country in WooCommerce.

This is a limited plugin to switch automatically between payment gateways depending on the selected billing country.

It only allows for 3 countries, as the use case for the creation of this plugin only required 2, but I added a third one just in case.

For example, if your store operates in US and Canada, you can offer Moneris to the Canadian clients, but perhaps PayPal for the US clients.
